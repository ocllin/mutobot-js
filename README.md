# Muto Bot (Js)

A continuation of a Discord bot I have been developing for a small Discord server. This version is being written in node.js using the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) API.

I have taken a step back from the Python version and evaluated the servers needs in terms of functionality and have it currenty limited to:
- Voice channel functionality
- Level training guide
- Useful information
- Stamp command
